 * ClassName: MaxDeviationAmongAll
 * Description:
 * date: 28/5/2022 上午10:54
 *题目
 * Let's have a string: abbbcacbcdce
 * For substring abbb, you have most frequent letter b -> 3 and least frequent letter a -> 1.
 * So the deviation is = most frequent - least frequent = 3 - 1 = 2. You need to look at all the substrings and >find the max deviation.
 * Here substring cacbcdc has the max deviation.
 * Frequency is like below:
 * c -> 4, a ->1, b->1, d->1.
 * So max freq - min freq = 4 - 1 = 3.
 * Among all substrings deviation, this is the max. So need to return it.
 * String length is 10^4. So you can't check each substring.
